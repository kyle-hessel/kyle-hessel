## Hey there!

I am a generalist developer from Arizona trying my hand at a mix of game, web, and software development in both my professional and spare time. On my profile you can find a collection of repositories spanning the gamut of my interests.

If you want a more visual look at my work, feel free to watch the following videos below to get a better sense of the types of tools and features I tend to focus on. Thanks for stopping by!
